# BinarySearchTreeExample
This is an example of a binary search tree data structure, with a driver class which loads the tree with words and allows the user to manipulate the tree/examine its efficiency. I created this project in my Computer Science II (Data Structures) class.

Launch the program from the TreeDriver class. Once launched, follow the console commands to explore the binary search tree.
